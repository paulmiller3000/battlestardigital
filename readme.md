## Enhancements
### Planned
- Move the database name, user name, and password to a config file
- Move the home page URL to a config file
- Create an admin console
- Add SITENAME variable to admin console
- Develop simple article posting tool that allows for hyphens in article URLs
- Develop page posting tool that replaces physical PHP pages in **/app/views/pages** with an admin and database-driven approach

## Getting Started
1. Update lines 13 and 16 in **/app/config/config.php**. Lines 3 through 6 are not yet in use.
2. And, of course, update the actualy content in **index.php** and **/app/views/pages**.
